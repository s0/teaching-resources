These teaching resources are a collection I have put together for teaching
Computer Science and ICT to Students of [LVS
Oxford](http://www.lvs-oxford.org.uk/), a school for children on the autistic
spectrum.

This collection will grow as the students at the school require more content,
and the content will be geared mostly for classroom environments where each
student has their own computer to work on, with suitable prerequisites.

Feel free to use this collection of resources as you see fit, and if you would
like to, you can contribute by submitting a PR over at the [github
repository](https://github.com/samlanning/teaching-resources).

And lastly, please of course respect the copyright requirements of any assets
that I use throughout the resources.
